Supposing that system has small limit of any resource it can provide
and a lot of processes require that resourece

In that case Avoidance will be better, because

in such condition probability of deadlock is pretty high and ignoring it will lead to frequent reboots. Also due to frequent deadlocks recovery will be performed a lot, which is bad, because recovery is a high-cost operation. Thus avoidance will keep system safe with smaller overhead than recovery, while preventing deadlocks from happening, thus saving system from need to be rebooted frequently.
